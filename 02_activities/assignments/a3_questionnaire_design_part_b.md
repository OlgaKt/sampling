# Assignment: Questionnaire Design (Part B)

## Requirements
1. Comment on the quality of your sample. Do you expect it to be representative of your target population? Why or why not?

    ```
    I expect the sample to be representative of the target population. The use of a stratified random sampling strategy enhances representativeness by ensuring that employees from various departments are included proportionally. This reduces bias that could arise from sampling only from a single department. Although, the representativeness will also depend on factors like response rate and the accuracy of the sampling frame.
    ```

2. Given the class content (error, survey quality, ethics) covered since Part A of the assignment, do you wish to make any changes to your original survey? If so, make a copy of your original survey and make any desired changes. Describe the changes and your reasoning. Provide a link here for submission.

    ```
    My original survey included many open-ended questions, and I amended them so that the survey analysis process would be easier. I also added additional questions to better understand why the turnover is happening, and what changes could be done to improve employee satisfaction.

1. How long have you been employed at our company?
- Less than 6 months
- 6 months to 1 year
- 1 to 2 years
- More than 2 years

2. On a scale of 1 to 5, how satisfied are you with your current role?
1 (Very Dissatisfied) - 5 (Very Satisfied)

3. To what extent do you feel supported by your immediate supervisor or manager in your day-to-day tasks and career development?

- Not supported at all
- Minimally supported
- Somewhat supported
- Very supported
- Fully supported

4. Do you feel that your contributions at the company are recognized and valued?

- Yes, always
- Yes, sometimes
- No, rarely
- No, never

5. How would you rate your overall experience working in the company?
- Excellent
- Good
- Fair
- Poor

6. How satisfied are you with the opportunities for professional development and growth provided by the company?

- Very Dissatisfied
- Dissatisfied
- Neutral
- Satisfied
- Very Satisfied

7. Have you considered leaving the company in the past 6 months?

- Yes
- No

8. What changes or improvements do you think could be made to enhance employee satisfaction and reduce turnover within the company? (Select all that apply)

- Increase salary and benefits
- Provide more opportunities for career advancement
- Improve work-life balance initiatives
- Enhance training and professional development programs
- Foster a more inclusive and supportive workplace culture

9. If you have considered leaving, what were the primary reasons for this consideration? (Check all that apply)

- Better job opportunities elsewhere
- Dissatisfaction with current role
- Issues with management
- Compensation and benefits
- Work-life balance concerns
- Other (please specify)

8. Are there any additional comments or feedback you would like to provide regarding your experience working at our company?
    ```

3. Could the purpose of your survey have been fulfilled through an observational study? If yes, how? If no, why not?

    ```
The purpose of the survey could potentially be fulfilled through an observational study, but it would have limitations compared to a survey. We could observe and document turnover rates, employee behaviors, and organizational practices without directly intervening or asking employees for their perceptions and opinions. And while such a study could complement a survey by providing objective data on turnover rates and observable behaviors, a survey is more essential for HR to understand the subjective experiences and perceptions of employees, which are critical for designing effective retention strategies and improving overall employee satisfaction.

	3.	Identify and understand sources of error or inaccuracies in data as a result of sampling strategies.
	4.	Develop intuition around survey quality.

## Rubric
